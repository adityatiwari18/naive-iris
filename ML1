How would you handle an imbalanced dataset?

The imbalanced dataset can be handed by
-> Upsampling or undersampling the dataset
-> Synthetically producing the minority data using K nearest neighbours (SMOTE)
-> Dividing majority data into batches and training with minority data separately and finally choosing the best model.
